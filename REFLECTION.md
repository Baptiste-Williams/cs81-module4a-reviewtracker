# Reflection

## What was helpful about this assignment?
I found it helpful to write function summaries and inline comments. 
It made me think more  about what each part of the code is doing.

## What was confusing?
At first, I wasn’t sure where to put the improvement comment or how to write a test case, but
once I did some research, it made sense.

## What is one improvement you suggested and why?
I suggested improving the "mostReadBook" function so it could return all books tied for most read, not just one.
This would give a more complete picture of the user’s reading habits.
